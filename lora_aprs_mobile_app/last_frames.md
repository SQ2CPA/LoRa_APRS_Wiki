## Frames List

This screen displays a list of all your recent sent and received packets.

Each entry in the list is color-coded:

-   **Green-highlighted** frames are packets received (Rx) by your device.
-   **Orange-highlighted** frames are packets sent (Tx). This includes both packets sent automatically by your TNC (e.g., a beacon) and packets sent from the app (e.g., messages).

## Bottom Buttons

At the bottom of the screen, there are two floating buttons:

-   **Download Frames**: Allows you to download the current list of frames as a raw text file. This is useful for analysis or debugging.
-   **Clear List**: Clears the entire list of frames displayed on this screen.
