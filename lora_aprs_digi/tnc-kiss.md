title: TNC (KISS) Functionality
permalink: /lora_aprs_digi/tnc-kiss/
---

Our firmware includes a built-in Terminal Node Controller (TNC) that uses the standard KISS protocol. This feature turns your device into a modem, allowing it to act as a bridge between the LoRa radio network and APRS applications running on your computer or smartphone.

You can connect to the TNC through two primary interfaces: **TCP/IP** (over your local Wi-Fi network) or the physical **Serial/USB** port. Both interfaces allow you to send and receive APRS packets using any KISS-compatible software.

This functionality can be enabled or disabled in the "TNC Settings" section of the web configuration panel.

## TCP/IP KISS Server

When the device is connected to your Wi-Fi network, it can run a KISS TNC server. This allows you to connect APRS software to it wirelessly over your local network.

-   **Port**: The server runs on port `8001`.
-   **Connections**: It supports up to 4 simultaneous client connections.

This is the most convenient method for connecting modern applications without needing a physical cable.

## Serial KISS Interface

For a more traditional setup, the TNC can also be accessed via the device's USB serial port. When you connect the device to your computer, it will appear as a COM port that you can connect to with your APRS software. This method provides a direct, wired connection to the TNC.

## Compatible Software

The TNC is compatible with a wide range of APRS software that supports the KISS protocol. While classic applications like **APRSIS32** (Windows) or **APRSDroid** (Android) will work, we highly recommend using modern, web-based clients for the best experience.

### Recommended Applications

1.  **APRS TNC Web**

    -   A modern, browser-based TNC web server that runs on any device on your local network. It requires no installationâ€”simply open the web page and connect to your device's IP address from within your local network.
