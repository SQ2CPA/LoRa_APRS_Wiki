The **LoRa APRS Tracker** firmware is designed to run on specific hardware that includes GPS/GNSS capabilities (or can be easily added). Below is the list of officially supported boards.

> We don't support a vast number of devices, but the ones we do are well-tested and proven to be stable. Our focus is on quality over quantity. If a new, popular, and stable device emerges and is widely adopted by the community, it will likely be added and fully supported in the future.
