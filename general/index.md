# General Information

This **General** section contains information that applies to almost all projects. Here you will find general information about support, project organization, and other cross-cutting topics.

However, information here is generally not duplicated from the [LoRa-APRS.pl](https://lora-aprs.pl) website. Most detailed information about LoRa APRS (network operation, devices, etc.) can be found there.

## What's in this section?

This section covers:

-   Support channels and how to get help
-   Project organization and contribution guidelines
-   General resources applicable across multiple projects
-   Links to external resources and documentation

For specific information about LoRa APRS operation, devices, and network details, please visit [LoRa-APRS.pl](https://lora-aprs.pl).
